# 100x Week 2 â€” Lost Civilization Prompting (SDXL)

In this assignment, we will **recreate 15 images** that tell the story of a lost civilization from its mysterious beginnings to its untimely demise.  
All images must be generated in a **cohesive visual style**, discovered from the reference image provided (see Lecture 4 for hints).  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Capture the **timeline of a lost civilization** in 15 stages.  
- Maintain a **consistent artistic style** across all images.  
- Avoid common AI distortions (hands, faces, tiling).  
- Ensure final outputs are **1024x1024** and **upscaled**.  
- Showcase all images together in a **compiled PDF**.  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Repo Layout
- `prompts/` â†’ text prompts for each timeline moment  
- `outputs/` â†’ generated images (1024x1024, upscaled)  
- `pdf/` â†’ final compiled PDF for showcase  
- `reference/` â†’ given style reference image

## ðŸ“œ Timeline Overview (Detailed)

1. **The Awakening**  
   Depict the mysterious origins of this ancient civilization, shrouded in myth and legend. Their knowledge seems to emerge from nowhere, with glowing symbols, strange artifacts, and the first signs of their extraordinary wisdom.  

2. **The First Builders**  
   Show their early architectural triumphs â€” vast stone monuments, colossal temples, and intricate carvings that even surpass the pyramids. The structures should radiate both power and mystery.  

3. **Age of Innovation**  
   Illustrate their astonishing advancements in technology: energy systems, mechanisms, and devices that feel far beyond even modern understanding. A blend of futuristic and ancient elements should be visible.  

4. **Masters of the Elements**  
   Represent their ability to harness nature â€” controlling water to irrigate cities, fire as a source of power, and air to drive colossal machines. Their harmony with the natural world elevates their society.  

5. **Cultural Renaissance**  
   Capture a golden age of creativity: sculptures, paintings, vast libraries, theatrical performances, and flourishing philosophy. Their cultural influence spreads across regions, marking an era of intellectual glory.  

6. **Heavenly Vessels**  
   Show their exploration of the skies and possibly outer space â€” strange flying crafts, celestial observatories, and cosmic navigation tools. They hold a profound understanding of the stars.  

7. **The Great Expansion**  
   Depict their civilization spreading across continents. Massive cities, sprawling colonies, and cultural outposts rise in distant lands, showing their ambition and unmatched organizational power.  

8. **Mysterious Guardians**  
   Illustrate the creation of protectors â€” powerful stone golems, mechanical guardians, or robotic sentinels stationed to defend their sacred cities. They radiate both strength and enigma.  

9. **The Eternal Watchers**  
   Portray the merging of consciousness with advanced constructs. These beings are AI-like entities, eternal observers of both time and knowledge, blending organic wisdom with mechanical immortality.  

10. **Conflict of Power**  
    Show the seeds of downfall: ruling factions clash, elites fight over resources and control, and once-united citizens divide. Darkness begins to shadow their golden age.  

11. **Shadows of the Catastrophe**  
    Represent the early disasters â€” plagues, great floods, eruptions, or cosmic disturbances. The once-flourishing empire begins to fracture under pressures they cannot control.  

12. **The Last Stand**  
    Depict their desperate attempts to save their legacy: final battles, collapsing technologies, and sacred rituals to protect what remains. Their last efforts are both tragic and heroic.  

13. **Vanished Cities**  
    Show the aftermath â€” cities reduced to ruins, reclaimed by jungles, deserts, or oceans. Their monuments stand broken, silent reminders of a lost glory hidden beneath time.  

14. **The Forgotten Lore**  
    Illustrate the remnants of knowledge left behind: ancient scrolls, hidden crystal devices, or holographic records stored deep in caverns or temples, waiting for rediscovery.  

15. **Echoes in Time**  
    Conclude with how traces of their existence still echo into modern times â€” forgotten symbols reappearing in todayâ€™s world, their influence unknowingly shaping our own civilization.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Use **SDXL** as the base model.  
2. Recreate each timeline moment via **prompt engineering** (trial & error).  
3. Ensure outputs are `1024 x 1024`.  
4. Collect results in `outputs/` and compile into a single PDF (`pdf/`).
